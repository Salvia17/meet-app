User stories and Gherkin syntax

FEATURE 1: FILTER EVENTS BY CITY
USER STORY FEATURE 1: As a user, I should be able to filter events by city, so that I can see what is happening where I am located.
Scenario 1: When user hasn’t searched for a city, show upcoming events from all cities.
⦁	Given user hasn’t searched for any city;
⦁	When the user opens the app;
⦁	Then the user should see a list of all upcoming events.
Scenario 2: User should see a list of suggestions when they search for a city.
⦁	Given the main page is open;
⦁	When user starts typing in the city textbox;
⦁	Then the user should see a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they’ve typed.
Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list.
⦁	Given the user was typing “Berlin” in the city textbox and the list of suggested cities is showing;
⦁	When the user selects a city (e.g., “Berlin, Germany”) from the list;
⦁	Then their city should be changed to that city (i.e., “Berlin, Germany”) and the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city.

FEATURE 2: SHOW/HIDE AN EVENT'S DETAILS
USER STORY FEATURE 2: As a user, I should be able to show/hide an event's details, so that I can see what is exactly happening at each event.
Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default.
⦁	Given an app and list event element has been loaded;
⦁	When the user hasn't clicked on details button yet;
⦁	Then an event element is collapsed by default.
Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see its details.
⦁	Given an app and list event element has been loaded;
⦁	When the user clicks on details button;
⦁	Then an event element will expand to show its details.
Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide its details.
⦁	Given an app is loaded and event element has been expanded;
⦁	When the user clicks on hide details button;
⦁	Then an event element will collapse to hide its details.

FEATURE 3: SPECIFY NUMBER OF EVENTS
USER STORY FEATURE 3: As a user, I should be able to change the number of events, so that I can choose the number of events to view at one time.
Scenario 1: When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 is the default number.
⦁	Given the user hasn't specified the number of events;
⦁	When the app is loaded;
⦁	Then the default number of events to load is 32.
Scenario 2: User can change the number of events they want to see.
⦁	Given the app and events are loaded;
⦁	When the user changes the default number of events to show;
⦁	Then the number of events loaded should change to match the number user chose.

FEATURE 4: USE THE APP WHEN OFFLINE
USER STORY FEATURE 4: As a user, I should be able to use the app offline, so that  I don’t need internet access to see the events I was viewing previously.
Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection.
⦁	Given there is no internet connection;
⦁	When the user opens the app;
⦁	Then the app should show data that was loaded last.
Scenario 2: Show error when user changes the settings (city, time range).
⦁	Given there is no internet connection and the app is open;
⦁	When the user tries changing settings (city, time range);
⦁	Then the app shows error message saying in order to change settings the user must reconnect to internet.

FEATURE 5: DATA VISUALIZATION
USER STORY FEATURE 5: As a user, I should be able to view a chart of events in each city, so that I can see the number of upcoming events in each city.
Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city.
⦁	Given the user has selected to view events in few cities;
⦁	When the user opens an app;
⦁	Then the user should be able to see a graph or chart with multiple cities and number of events in each city for better visualisation and easier choosing.
